    <h1>How to Write a Chinese Poem</h1>

<p>A well-known Japanese poet was asked how to compose a Chinese poem. The usual Chinese poem is four lines,&#8221; he explained. The first line contains the initial phrase; the second line, the continuation of that phase; the third line turns from this subject and begins a new one; and the fourth line brings the first three lines together. A popular Japanese song illustrates this:</p>

<p>&#8220;Two daughters of a silk merchant live in Kyoto, The elder is twenty, the younger, eighteen. <br />
A soldier may kill with his sword, <br />
But these girls slay men with their eyes.&#8221;</p>
